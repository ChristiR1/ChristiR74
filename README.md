- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on This business I've been trying to start since the beginning and COVID... It shouldn't be seen near and dear to my heart because I'm disabled and there's quite a bit at times I can't do because of my back or money or just cuz I don't have the know-how do I have to depend on other people and it makes me feel kind of down in the dumps in bed in my gum a burden on others so I started this company and I'm having a hard time with it because I don't have the funds or the tool that I use to so I'm looking for an investor co-conspirator or let's say CO-owner operator of this business... Let the silent partner that helps with finances that likes to help other people in the world.  
you don't need an investor Silent Partner whatever you want to call it to help me get the equipment and vehicle or something to transport the equipment to the jobs or let's say projects to help the needy in other people that need the help I call him jobs because that's what they are to me I'm not really being paid for them you think you give me any money for the job that I do I put it all back into helping the next person or replenishing my tools or supplies that's why I called this business  
Mamma C's Home Helpers! The Company with a heart!
